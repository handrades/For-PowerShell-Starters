# Powershell - The Big Picture

## Who am I?

## What is Powershell?
---

Is a Scripting Language built on top of .Net framework and in later releases on top of .Net Core.

## How it works?
---

In a nutshell:

### Gets Data | Filters it | Displays it <- This is the take away

You define the order:
* Get
* Set
* Delete
* Filter
* Display - Always at the end
* etc.

All this could happen in one line of code

**In my personal opinion** PowerShell is the best at retrieving data, filtering it and displaying it in a simple and logical way.

Not only you can retrive data with PowerShel, but you can also create, delete, update objects. But for starters we will stick with just retrieving data, filtering it and displaying it.

## Where can I use PowerShell?
---

Windows, Linux and Mac.

## Why should I care?
---

Because it is **STANDARIZED** it is easier to learn. (cd, dir, set-location, get-childitem)

Syntax is in English, you already have a big advantage. **VERB**-**NOUN**

It is going to make you **VERY** productive with very **MINIMAL** lines of code.

So first clone this repo and save it on your downloads folder. I have VS Code installed so thats what I'll be using as a text editor to view the PowerShell files. You can use your favorite text editor. Finally Open PowerShell. So with my setup I could execute the following lines of code in PowerShell to open **2 - Get.ps1** in VS Code.

```powershell
cd '~\Downloads\For PowerShell Starters'
code '.\2 - Get.ps1'
```
